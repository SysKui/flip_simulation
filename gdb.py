    Except there will be 10 bits flip occur in 1 GB RAM per month.
    For 5 years and 16 GB RAM machine in space, there will be 5 * 12 * 16 * 10 = 9600 times flip.
    There are 5 * 360 * 24 * 3600 = 155,520,000 seconds in 5 years, so one flip occurs every 155520000 / 9600 = 16200 seconds.
    One bit flip use nearly 0.155s in program, we assume 0.5s in program as 16200s in real world, 
    so program sleep 0.345s after every flip.
    We simulate 8G machine in 5 years, in other word we simulate 4800 times flip. 
    Because every flip takes 0.5s in program so the program will run 40 minutes.
