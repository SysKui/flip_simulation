# This file tests the failure rate of a machine after a single particle
# flip occurs and the machine runs for a period of time.
# The testing method is to save a snapshot of the machine before the flip,
# run it for a period of time after the flip, record the running status,
# then load the previous snapshot and repeat the experiment.
